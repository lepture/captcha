This is the APIs for your daily works. We do have built-in voice data and font
data. But it is suggested that you use your own voice and font data.


Contribution
------------

We need voice wav files. The voice wav file should be in 8-bit, please keep it
as small as possible. Name your voice file as::

    {{language}}-{{character}}-{{username}}.wav
    # example: zh-1-lepture.wav

TODO: we need a place to upload voice files.
